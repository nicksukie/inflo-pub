Inflo is a software project and startup I developed over the course of my master's program at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology over the course of 2018-2019. It was designed to be a social media platform optimized for the sharing and discussion of news content. It was released in beta at the end of 2019 and can be found at inflo.news/login. More information about the project can be found at infloproject.com or in the file /README-longversion.pdf, which is my 100 page masters thesis which goes in-depth about all elements of the project; conceptual, technical, and with a hypothetical business model if it were to become monetized.
